# 🧮  Product of Array Except Self 

## 📝 Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

## 📌 Example
**Input:**  
nums = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** 
[24,12,8,6]
**Explanation:** 
prefixProduct = [ 1,1,2,6]
suffixProduct = [24,12,4,1]
result = [24,12,8,6]

## 💡 Approach
1. Create an output array ans.

2. Left pass:

     Traverse from left to right.

     Store the product of all elements before index i in ans[i].

3. Right pass:

     Traverse from right to left.

     Keep a running right product.

     Multiply it with the existing value in ans[i].

4. The result is built without extra arrays.

## 🧑‍💻 Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        int left = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans[i] = left;
            left = left * nums[i];
        }
        int right = 1;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {

            ans[i] *= right;
            right *= nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
