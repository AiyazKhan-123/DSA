# 🚀 DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/), and other coding platforms.  
I use this repo to **track my progress, stay consistent, and prepare for coding interviews**.
